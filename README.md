# WebPresentation
Sample presentation created at the request of someone who found Powerpoint and PDFs lacking in what they wanted to do.

Buttons made to look like links will open an associated image and close previously open images.

Made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

TODO:

-Add more display options for images of varying sizes

-Adjust how the site displays for mobile devices
